# wellknown

**Universal Go library for generating and opening deep links across the Google and Apple app ecosystems.**
Pure Go · Zero deps · Deterministic URLs · Cross-platform.

## WHY

https://github.com/joeblew999/wellknown is building up URI Schema so that we can have our own open gateway and publish into the Apple, Google ones when we need to collaborate with those not using the Self hosted Gateway system

For example you could host videos on your cloud or their devices BUT puboish to youtube and twitch for third parties .

Then you draw people back to YOUR system and not theirs, but can still have the network effect by publishing to YouTube and twitch.

The same goes for Email, Cal, Contacts, Maps ....

## ✨ Overview

`wellknown` lets Go applications and CLIs create **native deep links** and **URL schemes** for common apps such as:

| Category | Google | Apple |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Calendar | `googlecalendar://render?...` | `calshow:` |
| Maps | `comgooglemaps://?q=` | `maps://?q=` |
| Mail | `mailto:` | `mailto:` |
| Drive / Files | `googledrive://` | `shareddocuments://` |

The library also provides safe fallbacks to open the **web equivalents** when native apps aren't available.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ **Pure Go** — no external dependencies.
- 🧠 **Deterministic**: same input → same output (great for reproducible infra / NATS messages).
- ⚙️ **Cross-platform**: works on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.
- 🕹 **Programmatic & CLI**: embed in binaries or call from shell scripts.
- 🔗 **App-aware**: automatically chooses local URL scheme vs. browser fallback.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
make go-dep    # Install development tools
make run       # Start unified server (API + Demo UI)
```

The server will start on **port 8090** with:

- **Admin UI**: [http://localhost:8090/_/](http://localhost:8090/_/)
- **Demo UI**: [http://localhost:8090/demo/](http://localhost:8090/demo/)
- **API Docs**: [http://localhost:8090/api/](http://localhost:8090/api/)

### Architecture

**Unified Server (Port 8090)**
- PocketBase backend with SQLite
- RESTful API endpoints (`/api/*`)
- Demo & testing UI (`/demo/*`)
- Admin interface (`/_/*`)

### Available Commands

See all commands:
```bash
make help
```

Common tasks:
```bash
make go-dep         # Install development tools
make run            # Start unified server
make gen            # Generate type-safe models from database
make bin            # Build production binary
make test           # Run all tests
make fly-deploy     # Deploy to Fly.io
```

## 📋 Migration Notice

**Note**: The standalone server (`wellknown server`) has been merged into the unified server.

All demo features are now available at `/demo/*` routes:

```bash
# Old (deprecated)
wellknown server                    # Port 8080
http://localhost:8080/google/calendar

# New (current)
wellknown pb serve                  # Port 8090
http://localhost:8090/demo/google/calendar
```
